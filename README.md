# Transmitance-plotter
 Programme made for plotting of response of a dynamic system with transmitance in the shape of a constant over a 4th degree polynomial. It plots a response to both step and sine functions, as well as a Bode plots of the system. It uses an implementaion of Hurwitz criterion in order to check the stability of the system and find all its roots. Made as an assignment for university work.
